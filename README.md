## Commit message format

This boiler plate uses the **semantic-release** package to manage versioning. Once it has been set up, version numbers and Github release changelogs will be automatically managed. **semantic-release** uses the commit messages to determine the type of changes in the codebase. Following formalized conventions for commit messages, **semantic-release** automatically determines the next [semantic version](https://semver.org) number, generates a changelog and publishes the release.

Use `npm run commit` instead of `git commit` in order to invoke Commitizen commit helper that helps with writing properly formatted commit messages.
